[dockable_probe]

dock_position: 23, 300, 3.5
#   The physical position of the probe dock relative to the origin of
#   the bed. The coordinates are specified as a comma separated x, y, z
#   list of values. Certain dock designs are independent of the z axis.
#   if a z value is provided for these configurations, the z axis will
#   be raised to that amount in order to prevent collisions.
#   This parameter is required.
approach_position: 60, 300, 3.5
#   The X,Y position where the toolhead needs to be prior to moving into the
#   dock so that the probe is aligned properly for docking or attaching.
#   This parameter is required.
detach_position: 15, 300, 29
#   Similar to the approach_position, the detach_position is the X,Y
#   where the toolhead is moved after the probe has been docked.
#   For magnetically coupled probes, this is typically perpendicular to
#   the approach_position in a direction that does not cause the tool to
#   collide with the printer.
#   This parameter is required
#safe_z_position: 0,0
#   Optional parameter. If the probe is being used to home the Z
#   axis, the toolhead will move to these xy coordinates prior to homing.
#   If this value is not provided, the center of the bed will be used.
#dock_retries:
#   The number of times to attempt to attach/dock the probe before raising
#   and error and aborting probing.

lift_speed:    25
detach_speed:  40   # 30
attach_speed:  40   # 30
travel_speed: 200  # 120
#   Optional speeds used during various moves. These will default to probe
#   speed if not specified.
check_open_attach:     True
#   The probe status should be verified prior to homing. Setting this option
#   to true will ensure the probe "endstop" is "open" if the probe is attached
#   and will abort probing if it reports "triggered" when docked
#probe_sense_pin:
#   This supplemental pin can be defined to determine an attached state
#   instead of check_open_attach
#dock_sense_pin:
#   This supplemental pin can be defined to determine a docked state in
#   addition to probe_sense_pin or check_open_attach
allow_delayed_detach: True
#   When true, the probe will stay attached to the toolhead after the
#   completion of a command in case there is another command requiring the
#   use of the probe in the command queue. Once all commands have completed,
#   the probe is docked. It is recommended to add the DETACH_PROBE command to
#   macros and slicer start gcode to ensure the probe is correctly detached.
#   See Annexed_Probe.md for more information
dock_fixed_z: False
#   Whether or not the dock is located independently of the Z axis such as
#   mounted to a moving gantry.
